## 3. Question to Determine Programming Languages

1. What's your primary  language?
    > * C or C++ : Use C, C++ or Rust
    > * Matlab or R : Use Python or Julia
    > * Python : Use Go or Julia
    > * Nothing : Use Python or Mathematica /  Study C/C++

2. What's your coding level?
    > -Can you calculate sum of some sequences?  (No :  Zero)  
    > -Do you know OOPs or Functional Programming? (No : Low)  
    > -Can you use pointer? (No : Intermediate)  
    > -Can you use type and method? (No : Intermediate)
    > * Zero : Use Mathematica or Matlab or Python
    > * Low : Study C/C++ or Python / Challenge Julia
    > * Intermediate : Study Go or Rust / Use Julia or Python or C/C++
    > * Else : Do anything

## 4. Conclusion

Personally, I recommend **Julia** to future Physicists. But there are many libraries written by **C++**, so you should study **C++** if you want to become experimental Physicist. If you don't have any programming experiences, then you'd better to study **Python** first. If you hate programming, then **Mathematica** is the best solution.
