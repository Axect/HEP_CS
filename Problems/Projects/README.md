## 1. Running Gauge Couplings

In real world, there are no real physical constants - Every constants are scale dependent.
So, gauge coupling constants (g1, g2, g3) are also scale dependent. Thus, even though they are different now, they can be similar to high energy. We call this physics as High Energy Physics. Gauge coupling constants represent gauge forces - Electromagnetic, Weak and Strong interactions. Let's see their behavior at High Energy.

* Constants :
MpR      = 2.4 * 1E+18   // Reduced Planck Mass
	MW       = 80.385        // Mass of W
	MZ       = 91.1876       // Mass of Z
	MH       = 125.09        // Mass of Higgs
	alphasMZ = 0.1182        // alphas(MZ)
	h        = 1E-04         // precision
	Step     = 1E+04 * 44    // Number of lists
